title: "Multimodal Neural Recording: fMRI-EEG-TMS (fET) System"
excerpt: "We developed a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)-electroencephalogram (EEG)-transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) instrument (fET instrument) capable of acquiring simultaneous fMRI and EEG during noninvasive single pulse TMS. We used this instrument to apply single-pulse TMS to the left DLPFC and test whether prefrontal EEG alpha phase moderates TMS-evoked top-down influences on subgenual, rostral and dorsal ACC. <br/><img src='/images/500x300.png'>"
